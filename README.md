# JasperReports® - Free Java Reporting Library

The **JasperReports Library** is the world's most popular open source reporting engine. 
It is entirely written in Java and it is able to use data coming from any kind of data source and 
produce pixel-perfect documents that can be viewed, printed or exported in a variety of document 
formats including HTML, PDF, Excel, OpenOffice, MS Word and other.

The report templates for the *JasperReports Library* are XML files which can be edited using a powerful,
open source, Eclipse-based report designer called [Jaspersoft Studio](https://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jaspersoft-studio).
Using *Jaspersoft Studio*, reports can be built out of any data source and can have their look and feel 
formatted for printing or on-screen reading, or can be deployed to a *JasperReports Server* instance,
